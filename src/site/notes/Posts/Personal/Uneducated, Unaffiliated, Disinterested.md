The setup is simple: casting an opinion on the matter. 

There are 3 parameters to evaluate between the person and the matter: 

- **Personal affiliation**: either having some degree of emotional attachment to the matter beyond baseline empathy that most people would have. 
- **Interest**: To be economically attached or not, i.e. *skin in the game*.
- **Education**: having a very high degree of proficiency such that they know the matter at hand almost at full.

And the simple conclusion can be that all 3 parameters should be maximal to achieve a good opinion. But is that always the case? some counter examples that I have encountered in my life:

- **Education**: In many technical conversations between those that are experts in a sub-system, it is super useful to have the opinion of someone who has some degree of high level information, but is not an expert and therefore can provide an out-of-the-box opinion. I have been on both sides of this myself.
- **Interest and Affiliation**: I am from Iran, and consider myself educated about conditions of living there, but because of living abroad for many years, less so emotionally and economically attached. In other words, I am in a position of privilege compared to those that actually still live in Iran. and I have found myself to sometimes have differing opinions about Iran, and think that this position of privilege can actually be useful (see [[Posts/Personal/My Thoughts On Iran's Political Situation in 2022\|My Thoughts On Iran's Political Situation in 2022]]). 

In short, what I would conclude is that in a given situation, it is useful to incorporate opinions that are either (somewhat) uneducated, unaffiliated and uninterested.
