*banī-ādam aʿzāy-e yek digarand*
*keh dar āfarīnesh 'zeh yek goharand*
*cho ʿozvī be-dard āvarad rūzgār*
*degar ʿozvhā rā namānad qarār*
*to k'az meḥnat-e dīgarān bī-ghamī*
*nashāyad keh nāmat nahand ādamī*

*Human Beings are members of a whole*
*In creation of one essence and soul*
*If one member is inflicted with pain*
*Other members uneasy will remain*
*If you have no sympathy for human pain*
*The name of human you can not pertain*
