> Love, in Rumi’s vision, is when the ego or carnal self (nafs) is naught; and such love is realized when the heart is open and the mind is awakened to the reality of life beyond the fictional ego.

## On The Pain and Joy of Longing

I am madly in love with you. What good is advice and preaching? 
I have drunk the killing water of love. What good is a little sugar? 
They say, “Put chains on his feet.” 
The madness is in my heart. What use is the chain on my feet? 

dar esh’ģ-e to’am, nasiihat o pand che suud? 
zah’râb cheshide’am, marâ ģand che suud? 
guuyand marâ ke: band bar pâsh nehid divâne del ast, 
pâm bar band che suud?


You’re gone, and in my longing I shed tears of blood. 
This ever-increasing grief of you makes me cry more. 
No, I’m not saying it right! When you left, my eyes went after you. 
Since my eyes have gone with you, how can I cry? 

rafti vaz raftan-e to, man khuun migeryam 
vaz ghosse-ye afzuun-e to, afzuun migeryam 
nay, khod cho to rafti, pe-ye to diide beraft 
chon diide beraft, baa’d az ân chun geryam?
## The Search 

Within your living being, there is a spirit. Search for it! 
In the mountain of your body, there is a jewel. Search for it! 
O, wandering Sufi! If you are looking for it, don’t seek it outside; it is to be found within you. 

dar jân-e to jâniist, bejuu ân jân 
râ dar kuuh-e to, dorriist, bejuu ân kân râ 
Sufi-ye ravande, gar to ân mi’juuyii 
biiruun to majuu, ze khod bejuu to ân râ

O pious seekers who are wandering in the world: 
Why are you perplexed by a mental idol? 
What you are seeking the whole world for, 
seek within yourself. You are already that.

ey ahl-e safâ ke dar jahân gardâniid 
az bahr-e boti cherâ chonin heyrâniid? 
uu râ ke shomâ dar-in jahân juuyâniid 
dar khod cho be-juuyiid; shoma khod âniid

In the streets of your own mind, what are you seeking? 
Why are you washing your eyes with tears of blood? 
From head to toe, you are possessed by Truth. 
Yet, you remain so ignorant of yourself: What else are you seeking? 

dar ku-ye khyâl-e khod che mi’puuyii to? 
vin diide be khuun-e del, che mi’shuuyii to?
az farg-e sarat tâ be ģadam, haģģ dârad 
ey bi’khabar az khiish, che mi’juuyii to?

You have severed our relationship, but I do not despair. 
You have chosen another lover, but I do not despair. 
As long as I live, your grief will be my food. 
There is much hope even in hopelessness; I do not even despair. 

niyam, garche ze man bobridii 
yâ bar sar-e man yâr-e degar 
tâ jân dâram, gham-e to khâham khordan 
besiyâr omiid hast dar nomiidii

If your quest is the soul’s home, you are that soul. 
If your search is for a loaf of bread, you are that bread. 
If you know this secret, you know the secret: 
That you are seeking, you are that.

gar dar talab-e manzel-e jâni, jânii
gar dar talab-e loģ’me-ye nâni, nânii
in nokte-ye ramz agar bedâni, dânii: 
har chiiz ke dar jostan-e âni, ânii
## Who Am I?

I am not concerned with to be or not to be. 
I am detached from them both. Yet, that is not bravery. 
The wonders in my heart don’t drive me crazy. 
This is bravery and the real madness!

bâ hasti o niisti-yam, bi’gânegist 
vaz har do boridanam, na 
gar man ze ajâyebi ke dar del dâram 
divâne nemishavam, ze divânegist

When your chest is washed clean from the ego, 
you will see your true self and your first love. 
You cannot see your own face without a mirror.
Look at the Beloved; He is your mirror.

chon pâk shod ze khodi-ye to, siine-ye to khod-bin gardi, ze yâr-e diiriine-ye to 
bi âyiine ruuye khiish natvâni diid 
dar yâr negar, ke uust âyiine-ye to

## The Beloved's Face 

As long as the face of that enviable angel is imprinted in my heart, 
in the whole world, who is as joyous in heart as I?
O God, to live this happy life is all I know.
I keep hearing about sorrow; what it is, I don’t know.

tâ dar del-e man suurat-e ân rashk pariist 
delshâd cho man, dar in hame âlam kiist? 
vallah ke be-joz shâd nemidânam ziist 
gham mishenavam, vali nemidânam chiist

## Die To Yourself

If you want your soul to be nourished and fulfilled; 
don’t go to sleep. Let the loving fire of the Beloved burn you; 
don’t go to sleep. For hundreds of nights you have slept; you know the outcome. 
Do yourself a Divine favor: Tonight until dawn don’t go to sleep. 

gar miikhâhi baģâ vo piruuz, 
az âtash-e eshģ-e duust, misuuz, 
sad shab khofti o hâsel-e ân diidii az bahr-e khodâ 
emshab tâ ruuz makhosp

The secret of madness is the wellspring of wisdom. 
Love’s madman is also a man of refined knowledge. 
One who becomes the heart’s friend through the path of pain, 
becomes a stranger to himself in a thousand ways. 

sar’mây-ye aģl, serre diivânegist 
diivâne-ye eshģ, mard-e farzânegist 
ân kas ke shod ashenâ-ye del dar rah-e dard
ba khiishtanash hezâr biiganegist

So full of yourself, you cannot taste drunkenness; 
attached to your Flesh, you cannot be devoted to the Soul. 
In the path of love, you will not reach the real being 
until you let go of yourself like water and fire. 

tâ hosh’yâri, be taa’me masti 
tâ tan nadahi, be jân parasti 
tâ dar rah-e eshģ-e duust chon âtash o âb 
az khod nashavi niist, be hasti naresi

## Art of Living

We are lovers of love. Submission to a creed is something else. 
We are poor ants, collecting love. 
Solomon’s kingly life is something else. 
In our longing, we have pale faces and torn hearts to offer. If you desire a fashion market, go somewhere else. 

mâ asheģ-e eshģiim o mosalmân degar ast
mâ muur-e za’iifiim o Soleymân degar ast 
az mâ rokh-e zard o jegar-e pâre talab 
bâzârche-ye ģasab foruushân degar ast
