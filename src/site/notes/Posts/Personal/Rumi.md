> Love, in Rumi’s vision, is when the ego or carnal self (nafs) is naught; and such love is realized when the heart is open and the mind is awakened to the reality of life beyond the fictional ego.

## On The Pain and Joy of Longing

I am madly in love with you. What good is advice and preaching? 
I have drunk the killing water of love. What good is a little sugar? 
They say, “Put chains on his feet.” 
The madness is in my heart. What use is the chain on my feet? 

dar esh’ģ-e to’am, nasiihat o pand che suud? 
zah’râb cheshide’am, marâ ģand che suud? 
guuyand marâ ke: band bar pâsh nehid divâne del ast, 
pâm bar band che suud?


You’re gone, and in my longing I shed tears of blood. 
This ever-increasing grief of you makes me cry more. 
No, I’m not saying it right! When you left, my eyes went after you. 
Since my eyes have gone with you, how can I cry? 

rafti vaz raftan-e to, man khuun migeryam 
vaz ghosse-ye afzuun-e to, afzuun migeryam 
nay, khod cho to rafti, pe-ye to diide beraft 
chon diide beraft, baa’d az ân chun geryam?
## The Search 

Within your living being, there is a spirit. Search for it! 
In the mountain of your body, there is a jewel. Search for it! 
O, wandering Sufi! If you are looking for it, don’t seek it outside; it is to be found within you. 

dar jân-e to jâniist, bejuu ân jân 
râ dar kuuh-e to, dorriist, bejuu ân kân râ 
Sufi-ye ravande, gar to ân mi’juuyii 
biiruun to majuu, ze khod bejuu to ân râ

O pious seekers who are wandering in the world: 
Why are you perplexed by a mental idol? 
What you are seeking the whole world for, 
seek within yourself. You are already that.

ey ahl-e safâ ke dar jahân gardâniid 
az bahr-e boti cherâ chonin heyrâniid? 
uu râ ke shomâ dar-in jahân juuyâniid 
dar khod cho be-juuyiid; shoma khod âniid
