Ack that Polkadot SDK is hard to understand, for multiple reasons: 
1. Depth of the knowledge, Web3, among the complicated web3 projects, novel aspects
2. Use of Rust, in a very very generic manner
3. Lots of changes from core-devs. 

- 3rd being fixed by stability.
- 2nd is not solve-able, and merely requires practice. We can to some extent improve it by using ideas like `opinionated frame system`, or `dumbing down FRAME`. 
- 1st is something like PBA content, and polkadot-sdk-docs can help with.
