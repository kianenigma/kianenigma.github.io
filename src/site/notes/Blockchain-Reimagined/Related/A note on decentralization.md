A random train of thought that unexpectedly lead to something about blockchain and Web3. 

Humans started decentralized. We lived as small tribes. Possession of things was minimal. Conflict was likely minimal.

Then agriculture came around. Value was created. Wealth was accumulated. We settled down. Cities were formed. Then, nation states, organizations, symbols, and religion. These held us together, and facilitated living by providing rules and dealing with contention. This created the first centralized sources of power in society. 

Then came telecommunication and thereafter the internet. Anything that could reach a city, by a day, and a kingdom by weeks of travel could now reach the world in an instant. Physical institutions became online empires. 

My hypothesis is, if we are to recreate civilization again, with the technology we have *today*, we would not have built cities, nation states, and all the institutions around them. They are just the evolution of the path that led is to this technology on the first place. We simply have much better technology, transport, and communication, such that we no longer have to squeeze in cities in order to live well. 

A few centuries ago jobs existed in the cities, and you had to move there or else it was not an option. Energy, food, transport, and many facilities were simply not possible anywhere outside if the centralized bubble of a city.

I think this is starting to change now. Most people still do live in cities, but more and more are moving away, simply because anything that was possibly within it is not possible almost anywhere. 

Now, take the same mindset to the digital aspect. We are still in the phase where we do have to live in big digital cities in order to have a "easy online life".

The question is, can we say the same about centralized part of internet as well? do we have the tools necessary to do that already? Such that any can an average person afford to be *independent* on the internet, metaphorically moving away from the big cities? Probably not yet. 

Web3, in my opinion, is a term for any technology that can help people get there. Perhaps with a bit more focus on the part of it that unlocks *transacting* with others due to the emphasis on blockchains. 

But thinking about it, with the above definition, and from a blank slate, what other technologies fit here? 

Examples:

1. Encryption
2. Proxies, VPNs. 
3. Unbiased fundamental applications: Browsers, Email clients, Password managers. 
4. ...

The physical problem will be solved by having less people. The latter will be solved by having more educated ones. Seemingly, time will help with both.
