## Brain Dumps after [[Blockchain-Reimagined/Presentation/Blockchain Scalability - A Holistic Recap\|Blockchain Scalability - A Holistic Recap]]

- DLTs broadly provide: 
	- Execution of some code that: 
		- Always happen and cannot be sensorred
		- Happens correctly. 
	- Audit-ability of history. This is where the blockchain dat structure comes into play.

A punch line I should think about is: Is a system that was formerly fully based on human trust, and now is partially based on human trust better?
