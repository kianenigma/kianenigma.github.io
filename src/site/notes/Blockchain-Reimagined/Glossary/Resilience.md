The broad term used to describe common properties of blockchain-based computation, most notably:
- **Reliable**: An event that was meant to happen, indeed happened.
- **Verifiably**: An event that happened was indeed correct, and anyone can check that.
- **Audit-ability**: The history of all events is visible and verifiable. 
- **Accessibility**: The system is more accessible. To access it, no permission is needed (banking the unbanked).
