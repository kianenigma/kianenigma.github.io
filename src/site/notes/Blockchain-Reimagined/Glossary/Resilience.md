The broad term used to describe common properties of blockchain-based computation and [[Blockchain-Reimagined/Glossary/Trust#Human-based Trust\|Trust#Human-based Trust]]:
- **Reliable**: An event that was meant to happen, indeed happened.
- **Verifiably**: An event that happened was indeed correct, and anyone can check that.
- - **Accessibility**: The system is more accessible. To access it, no permission is needed (banking the unbanked). Also called **Permissionless**.
- **Auditable**: The history of all events is visible and verifiable.
