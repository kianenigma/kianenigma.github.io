Blockchains are full of buzzwords, and a lot of people still don't get ***what they actually are***. More importantly, people don't have a good idea and what can be built with this technology, other than the casino of Defi which is already out there. 

In this talk, I represent blockchains-based-systems as world computer (analogy borrowed from Ethereum), then break down : 
1. How it works (spoiler: Blockchain is only a small part of it!) 
2. What properties this world-computer has 
3. Why Defi has been a successful product fit to this technology. Slides: [[Talks/2025/Blockchain for Beginners - Parity DOT Talk August 2025\|Blockchain for Beginners - Parity DOT Talk August 2025]]
