# Introduction

## Owning Money 

- €100 worth of Bitcoin, and €100 in your national bank of choice. What is the difference?

![Blockchain for Beginners - Parity Meetup April 2025 2025-04-29 16.01.17.png](/img/user/resources/Blockchain%20for%20Beginners%20-%20Parity%20Meetup%20April%202025%202025-04-29%2016.01.17.png)

### Owning Money 
- Revolut
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->🏦 Central Bank
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->👩‍⚖️ Judiciary System
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->🔫 Law Enforcement

--
### Owning Money 

- Bitcoin
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->🧮 Cryptography
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->🤑 (Crypto)Economic Security
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->🔂 Re-execution
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->⛓️‍💥 Did you notice a blockchain is not in the list? More on that later

> <!-- element class="fragment" -->Somehow we settled on calling systems that utilize the above, and happen to use a blockchain data-structure, a blockchain (system)

Notes: 
- Cryptography: Military-grade, politically neutral technology
- (Crypto)Economic Security: You diverge from correct behavior? You lose money
- Re-execution: A lot of re-execution of the same work by different parties

More on this in [[Talks/2024/Blockchain Scalability - A Holistic Recap\|Blockchain Scalability - A Holistic Recap]]

--
### Owning Money 

- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->🔫 + 🏦 + 👩‍⚖️ $\rightarrow$ Trust 
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->🧮 + 🤑 + 🔂  $\rightarrow$ **Truth** 
	- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->aka. Verifiable trust 
	- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" --> "*Less trust, more truth*"
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Blockchain systems yield a ***truthful computer***.

---
## Properties Of The Truthful Blockchain Computer

Let's examine

--
### Properties: Execution + Storage

- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Given a set of rules for the computer encoded as a **`code`**
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->And an **`input`** to that code
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->The `code` is executed correctly
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Any **`storage`** *update by that code* is truthful
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->*Truthful* **Execution** + **Storage**
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->What is the `code`, `input`, and `storage` in Bitcoin? 

--

### Properties: Execution + Storage

![Blockchain for Beginners - Parity Meetup April 2025 2025-04-29 16.04.43.png](/img/user/resources/Blockchain%20for%20Beginners%20-%20Parity%20Meetup%20April%202025%202025-04-29%2016.04.43.png)

--

### Properties: Auditable History + Strict Ordering 

- ⛓️‍💥 Blockchain (is **overrated**)!
- Blockchain != Blockchain-based system

![Blockchain for Beginners - Parity Meetup April 2025 2025-04-29 16.11.08.png](/img/user/resources/Blockchain%20for%20Beginners%20-%20Parity%20Meetup%20April%202025%202025-04-29%2016.11.08.png)

--

### Properties: Public

- Both `code` and `storage` and `input`s to that code need to be public for other network participants to verify it
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->🔂 **Re-execution necessitates (*some degree of*) publicity**
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->✅ ZK-SNARK proofs? Yes, that'll work
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->**When is this desirable?** Public/P2P interactions

--
### Properties: Digital

* Needless to say, this *truthfulness* **only applies to the execution of the `code`, and its side-effect `storage`**. 
* &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Not anything else, and importantly not the real world.
	* &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Oracle Problem
* &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->RWA???

Notes: 

Not to say RWA tokenization is bad... But it is fundamentally using Blockchains different compared to that of DeFi and alike.

--
### Properties: Decentralized $\rightarrow$ Unstoppable

- It is probably harder to (forcefully) shutdown Bitcoin than Revolut
- Decentralization
	- Technologically
	- Politically
	- Geographically
	- Ideologically 
--

### Properties: Expensive + Slow
- All of this dance to replace **Trust** with **Truth** doesn't come for free.

--

### Properties: Recap
- Pros: 
	- Secure computation and storage
	- Auditable + strict ordering
	- Public
	- Digital
	- Decentralization: Unstoppable
- Cons: 
	- Slow 
	- Expensive
	- Decentralization: No support hotline

---

## Evolution Of The Blockchain Computer

* From the point of view of the primary developers
* .. Although history tells us this leads to the user experience as well 🤭

--

### Evolution Of The Blockchain Computer

- Bitcoin: Domain-specific. Fixed `code` and `storage`
- 🦖 A lot of other dino-chains are similar

--

### Evolution Of The Blockchain Computer

- Smart Contract! 
	- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->A (limited) way to extend the `code` and `storage` of another blockchain computer
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" --> Ethereum, (most) Rollups, and anything else EVM-based
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" --> Solana, NEAR, ETH-killers and family

--

### Evolution Of The Blockchain Computer

- How about we have multiple blockchains with different `code` and `storage` each? 
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Polkadot / Cosmos
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Some Ethereum Rollups

--

### Evolution Of The Blockchain Computer

- How about we don't expose the blockchain to developers?
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Polkadot JAM, ICP, AR.IO, with differing properties

## Introduction Ends 

Questions? 

---

## Reflection / Discussion

* Not financial advise 😁

---

## What Have We Solved? 

--

### What Have We Solved

- ✅ Commoditization of digital goods
	- Stablecoins, Defi, GameFi, NFTs
	- Computation and Storage

### What We Might Solve

![Screenshot 2025-08-11 at 10.41.24.png](/img/user/resources/Screenshot%202025-08-11%20at%2010.41.24.png)

Note: 
- RFC 2616 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1, June 1999)

--

### What Have We *Failed* To Solved

- The ratio of money invested in blockchains vs Products is still very tilted
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Why? 
	- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Some due to lack of scalability 
	- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" --> Some due to stickiness 
	- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Some due to lack of PMF

--

### Lack of PMF

- We cannot determine what problem can a technology can solve, if we don't exactly understand what that technology does.

Notes:

* Social interactions, in societies large enough when you cannot trust one another

--

### Why DeFi is Perfect PMF

👉 NOT A COINCIDENCE 👈

- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->✅ Social interaction, needs truthful computer as intermediary
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->✅ Happens on entirely digital data
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->✅ Limited computation and storage needs
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->✅ Publicity is tolerable (thanks not having proper identity and pseudonym accounts)

--

### What Else Is a PMF?

- Don't hesitate to question: 
	- *Why should I build this using a blockchain and not put it on a Web2 server?*
- Look in your day to day life for user-journeys that benefit from a system with the above technologies
