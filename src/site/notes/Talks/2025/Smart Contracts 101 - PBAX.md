## Blockchain Models

--

### Blockchain Models
- Database ü§Æ
- A legacy of Bitcoing, and the (*limited*) UTXO model

![Smart Contracts 101 2025-04-23 15.49.08.png](/img/user/resources/Smart%20Contracts%20101%202025-04-23%2015.49.08.png)

--
### Blockchain Models

- State Machine ‚ôæÔ∏è
- Legacy of Ethereum, and the [YP](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf).

![Smart Contracts 101 2025-04-23 15.52.40.png](/img/user/resources/Smart%20Contracts%20101%202025-04-23%2015.52.40.png)


--
### Blockchain Models
- State Machine ‚ôæÔ∏è
	- State, represented as a list of `key -> value`s
	- State Transition Function

--
### Blockchain Models

- Computer üíª
- Legacy of Ethereum (the "*World Computer*"), Polkadot [JAM's Graypaper](https://graypaper.com/resources/).

![Smart Contracts 101 2025-04-23 16.00.57.png](/img/user/resources/Smart%20Contracts%20101%202025-04-23%2016.00.57.png)

Note: 

Database is utter BS
State Machine is accurate, but a bit to math-y
Computer is accurate, and one that most people relate to, we will use this one

## The Blockchain Computer
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Computer has `code` and `memory`. 
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Users can interact with the `code` (trigger a transfer üí∏)
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->`memory` stores *valuable* information (how much money I own ü§ë)
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->The main novelty of a computer is that it will execute `code` correctly, and therefore you can TRUST the `memory`. ü™Ñ

--

## The Blockchain Computer

- First generation blockchains had a fixed `code`. 
- What is the `code` / `memory` of the Bitcoin computer? 
	- <!-- element class="fragment" --> Transfer of BTC
	- <!-- element class="fragment" -->Is it extensible?

Note: 

First blockchains were computers with a (almost) fixed `code`. Bitcoin's `code` is ONLY how to do transfer of BTC, and therefore the State of the Bitcoin computer was only user balances. Nothing more. 

--

## The Blockchain Computer

- **Smart Contracts** are the first step into making blockchain computers ***programmable***. 

--
## Blockchain Computer

- **Ethereum** is a programmable blockchain computer
- What is the `code` of the Ethereum computer? 
	- Transfer of ETH <!-- element class="fragment" --> 
	- Upload a contract <!-- element class="fragment" --> 
	- Call into an existing contract, which might alter memory <!-- element class="fragment" --> 

--
## Blockchain Computer

- Execution of these contracts is as secure as the execution of the main blockchain's `code`. ü™Ñ
- <!-- element class="fragment" --> If you can trust Ethereum and its ability to correctly transfer ETH, you should also trust that it can correctly execute whatever is the code of any smart contract. 

---

## What Is A Smart Contract

A way to **add programs** with custom `code` and `memory` to the blockchain computer, making it **extensible**, with the very same **security guarantees**.


---

## Anatomy Of Smart Contracts

A Smart Contract has: 
- code 
- state/memory
- EVM has an opinion to see contracts exactly like user accounts
	- address (at which it can be invoked)
	- balance: money owned by the contract

Note: 
this is based on Ethereum/Solidity/EVM contracts
Bringing it all together


---

## How to Write a Contract

- Ethereum Contracts are written in a language **Solidity**
	- Part of the Ethereum `code` is to execute **Solidity**
- This happens in a virtual machine known as **EVM**
- `Solc`: Solidity -> EVM Bytecode

Note: 

EVM: Ethereum Virtual Machine

---

## How to Execute a Contract

If Ethereum wants to execute a totally untrusted code, what challenges does it have? 
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Deterministic cost (**gas**)
	- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->‚è∞ Metering!
	- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->‚õΩÔ∏è  `gas_limit`!
- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->Deterministic output (**EVM**)
	- &shy;<!-- element class="fragment" -->ü´† We I cannot make an HTTP request in a contract!

--

## Extending Memory

What about the fact that a contract can add more data to its own memory, which in turn bloats the overall blockchain memory? 

- State cost needs to be taken into account
	- Part of **gas**
	- **Deposit**
	- **State Rent**

## Lifecycle 

![contracts_compilation.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/contracts_compilation.png)

---

## Case Studies 

--
### Case Study

Simple Escrow Contract

- Buyer deposits funds 
- Both buyer and seller approve
	- Transfer funds to seller
- Timeout
	- Return funds to buyer

--

### Case Study

Web3 Roulette 

- Deposit Phase 
	- Anyone can deposit money into the contract 
- Roulette Phase
	- One participants get nothing back, their money split among everyone else



---

## Advance Topics

--

### Composability ~ Shared Environment 
- VMs on a hardware
	- Ethereum => Hardware 
	- Contracts => VMs
- Synchronous and Asynchronous 

Note: 

Contracts on Ethereum can always call one another

--

### Re-Entrancy Attacks

```[1-100|2|4-6|8-10|12-13|15|1-100]
contract EtherStore {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function deposit() {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() {
        uint256 bal = balances[msg.sender];
        require(bal > 0);

        (bool sent,) = msg.sender.call{value: bal}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");

        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
```

--

### Re-Entrancy Attacks

```
contract Attacker {
	// Our interface to EthStore contract
    EtherStore public etherStore;

    receive() external payable {
        etherStore.withdraw();
    }
}
```

## Smart Contracts in Polkadot 

![polkadot-new-dot-logo.png](/img/user/resources/polkadot-new-dot-logo.png)
---

## Polkadot 

- Computer who's `code` allows ***other Blockchains*** to be executed and validated.
- Polkadot always assumed one of these external blockchains (**Parachains**) would deliver smart contract capability.

---

## Past 

![Smart Contracts 101 2025-04-23 16.24.44.png](/img/user/resources/Smart%20Contracts%20101%202025-04-23%2016.24.44.png)

- A [lot of Polkadot-based blockchains](https://use.ink/chains/) use the above tech stack

Note: 

- Writing smart contracts in Rust: [Ink!](https://use.ink/how-it-works/), executed in a WASM.
- Writing in Solidity, executed in EVM [`pallet-evm`](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/)

Both of these initiated in Parity, but are pursued as community projects now. 

---

## Now 

- A new, much better virtual machine based on RiskV: [**PolkaVM**](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/announcing-polkavm-a-new-risc-v-based-vm-for-smart-contracts-and-possibly-more/3811)

![Smart Contracts 101 2025-04-23 16.24.44 1.png](/img/user/resources/Smart%20Contracts%20101%202025-04-23%2016.24.44%201.png)

--

## Now

- Outcome: Polkadot will have fast Solidity-compatible Smart Contracts in H2 2025
- [Demo](https://contracts.polkadot.io/)

---

## Open Question

- Smart Contract vs. AppChain Model

---

## Outro

- Smart Contracts are the most basic form of building an application on top of a **secure blockchain computer** ü™Ñ. 
- Battle tested approach that has been used for almost a decade now
