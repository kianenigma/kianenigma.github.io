## Prelude 

- Hello 👋🏻 `@kianenigma / kianenigma.nl`
- Polkadot for ~6 years
- Re-discover the fundamentals of blockchains
- I am here to solve industry-scale problems, not *sell a product*

Note:

1. I am a core engineer of Polkadot. 
2. On a journey to re-discover the fundamentals of blockchains. This talk is part of my journey.
	-  *Purpose-dysphoria*
3. Academic talk, not selling anything. Not talking much about Polkadot (*very little*)

## Owning Digital Money 

- €1000 in Revolut (🔫👮🧑‍⚖️⛪️ -> *Conditional Trust*)
- €1000 in the Bitcoin network (🧮 ♾️ -> *Synthesizes Verifiable Trust*)
- Economically secured validators (💻💰) doing redundant work 
 
Note:

Why do we trust each? 

- In Revolut, there is, in principle, as little as one computer, owned by Revolut, processes a transaction, and we trust the outcome of that, because of all the legal regulations around banking, government, law enforcements etc. 
- In the bitcoin network, we ***synthesize a new type of trust***, that is not based on social-norms, central-power, and law-enforcement, and is instead more based on branches of science, and is therefore **verifiable**, namely: mathematics, game theory and economics. 

> We don't trust a hash function to be one-way because a certain nation has a strong military, it is one way no matter who you are, and where you live. 

- A big part of this "*based on branches science*" is the fact that in a network like Bitcoin: 
	- a large number of actors can be the authority, each taking turn in become the **leader**
	- and many others, can check what that **leader** has done
		- We call this collective of the above two groups of entities "Validators"
	- All validators have skin in the game -> Economic Security 
	- All other nodes can observe and re-verify the behavior of validators

## Secure Validator Set Working Together 

![bi_cpu_models.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/blockchain-reimagined/bi_cpu_models.png)

Is one massive, ***SLOW***, **TRUSTWORTHY** computer.

Note:

- And a key reason why blockchains have a hard time scaling: All validator's at the simplest model, have to re-execute everyone else's work, and come to consensus/finality about it.

Question: Which Computer model is good, or perhaps good for which use cases? idk, deeper philosophical question.

Question statement: **How can I make the Web3 Computer go faster?** and while doing so, am I am compromising on the trust-worthy-ness of it? 

This is the core issue we try to tackle, how can we remove this property of "everyone re-executes everything".

## Scaling Options 

---

![hyperopt.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/blockchain-reimagined/hyperopt.png)
- `+` No fragmentation
- `-` Vertical scaling / Cutting corners? 

Note: 
- Somewhat like brute forcing it. 
- Needs careful consideration of how much of trust-worthiness of the original model it retains. 
	- Not having merklized state -> no light clients ever
	- Hardware requirements to run the network beyond what an individual can ever afford. 
- [Solana - How it Works (Helius)](https://report.helius.dev/)

---

![shardingsecyurity.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/blockchain-reimagined/shardingsecyurity.png)
- `-` Sharding Security and Capital / Limited Capital 

Note: 

- Cosmos' original view 
- There's only limited capital in the world, shard execution, and economic security. 
- Multi chains, in general real to a multitude of issues: 
	- 🐢 Slow and asynchronous communication
	- 💴 vs 💰 / 🥷: varying degrees of economic security, leading to a the weakest link issue
---

![optimistic.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/blockchain-reimagined/optimistic.png)

- `-` Slow finality / ⚠️ Need FP / Fragmented
- `+`  Little overhead on L1 (Execution, DA)

Note:

- little overhead on the base security layer, scales well:
	- New rollup, in the absence of fraud, no overhead on L1 in terms of execution, only DA
	- Although, in the presence of fraud, the L1 has to re-execute everything. I wonder how much this scales in the presence of frauds, and when compared to the cost of performing fraud. 
- slow finality
- In the presence of fraud proofs, it is secure. In the lack of of fraud proofs, it is a non-starter because it fully loses touch with the initial assumption of "the system is secure because of the L1 validators' economic security".

![cynical.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/blockchain-reimagined/cynical.png)

- `+` FP Is proactive and secure /  FAST finality / 🥷🔫 HOMOGENOUS security 
- `-` proactiveness is *not free*, but still scales well
- ELVES / Sharded Execution, Shared Security  / "Validator waiting room" analogy 

Note:
- Fraud prover is my neighboring validator, and is ***as secure as I am***. 
- Fraud prover is ***proactively*** asked to check my work. 
- In case of escalation, all validators participate. Hydra analogy. 
- This leads, through game theoretic and economic rules into a system that is functionally equivalent to **Shared Security, but sharded execution**. 
- [ELVES](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/961): The cost of attacking any of the L2s in this model, is as high as the cost of attacking the entire L1.

	- [Jeff Burdges (Web3 Foundation) - " WIP: Efficient Block-Auditing for Blockchains" - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teIFTSphE)
- Optimistic: Go to the room of validators, and if after 2 weeks no one says that something was wrong, you are good. 
- Cynical: Go to the room of validators, and ask 5 random validators out of 1000 what they think. Then ask 5 more random ones what they think of the

- `+` Secure
- `-` Expensive to prove, Generality

![polkadot.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/blockchain-reimagined/polkadot.png)

- Cores, Parachains

Note:
- [Bringing Polkadot tech to Ethereum - Layer 2 - Ethereum Research](https://ethresear.ch/t/bringing-polkadot-tech-to-ethereum/17104)
1. Higher Cost, an inevitability of the proactiveness of the security that Polkadot offers
2. Shorter time to finality
3. Possibility of implementing SPREE  
4. No weakest link issue. 

---
### Polkadot 2.0

- Make the usage of cores more flexible: 
	- Agile and On-demand
	- Elastic Scaling
	- Lower Block Times, 0.5 parachains are coming

![Pasted image 20250510180010.png](/img/user/resources/Pasted%20image%2020250510180010.png)

- Gutting and exposing Polkadot's core abilities. 
- You can only do this under the shadow of Cynical Rollups' shared security. 
- .. and a very powerful VM. 

Note:

JAM is a gutting of Polkadot that exposes: 
1. DA
2. Onchain 
3. In-Core

To the user of each core.


---
### JAM (2)

Why is JAM a big deal, and a step forward? 

> [!error]
> Persistent Fragmentation ❌

Note:

All models so far suffer from a property that we can call persistent fragmentation. The state associated with each application must live within the boundaries of its own walled garden. 

Through access to DA, and a fully unspecified scheduling, application that run on JAM (Services) need not suffer from persistent fragmentation, should they wish to. 

This is a big deal, and a step forward in the space of sharded blockchain.

- Strong Opinions? Later ;) 
- Talk + Recording

Note: 
- I tried to keep this talk intentionally un-opinionated, but I do have *stronger opinions* ;) 
	- Come talk to me afterwards, or perhaps the panel later today.

## Appendix

- I merged PoW and PoS fully, and I argue PoW is a specialized case of PoS in which stake is paid in hardware. Come change my mind.
